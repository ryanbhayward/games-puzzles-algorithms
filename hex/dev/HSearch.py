#    OPTIMIZED ? true or false
#       true: find connections to side, BOARD_X up to 50 no problem
#       false: *really slow*, but finds all(?) Anshelevich 
#          connections, more than 1-hour for 4x4
# 2-OR H-search proof of concept prototype
# Not optimized or thoroughly tested

# TODO
#   can we omit 1-semis?
#   how do we use 1-semi, 2-full, 3-semi... reasoning?
#   beyond 2-ors ... seed some critical connections, eg. 7652

# edits RBH 2023
# fixed names: or_rule, and_rule  (originally misleading)
# carriers:    only show EMPTY cells (omit player's stones)
# sanity check: print color sets E B W, print board
# added some small tests

# rbh: todo
# - vc.print: each pair output only once
# - semi: show key
# - unit tests
