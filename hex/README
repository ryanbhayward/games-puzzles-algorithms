different versions of a boolean negamax hex solver   revised 2025 rbh

hex_.py    simplest
   _tt.py  transposition table
   _vc.py  back up virtual connections (see Van Rijswijck  MSc thesis)
   _vc3.py faster
   _threat.py another vc.py that I wrote in a hurry
              without realizing I had already written _vc.py :)

xin_ fragments for xinyue's thesis

TODO
  * add TT to _vc.py etc
  * use modules to simple code reuse among above versions
  * make code more readable ala xin_mmx
  * update interact menu to show user how to solve
